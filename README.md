# Description -- WEBSITE IN CONSTRUCTION --

We are a group of engineers that work in the IT industry. We have decided to
share some scripts and libraries.

If you work in the same industry sure you have a small collection of scripts
and libraries. If you have ownership on that code feel free to make a pull
request to this page, we will revise it and if it is helpful accept it.

More information about coding styles etc [here](./developers.md).

## Shell Scripts

- [sh-ocrpdf]() : If you can't copy paste from a PDF, run this script
  and problem solved. It uses OCR.
- [sh-hp]() : Your scripts search programs using PATH, and search for
  your projects using `hp`. If you have an script `deploy-website` and
  a project `~/projects/website`, use `hp website` in your script to
  search it.

## Minimalist C libraries.
