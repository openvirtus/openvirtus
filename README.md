# Description

We are a group of engineers that work in the IT industry. We have decided to
share some scripts and libraries.

## Shell Scripts

- [sh-ocrpdf]() : If you can't copy paste from a PDF, run this script
  and problem solved. It uses OCR.
- [sh-hp]() : Your scripts search programs using PATH, and search for
  your projects using `hp`. If you have an script `deploy-website` and
  a project `~/projects/website`, use `hp website` in your script to
  search it.
- [sh-hreadme]() : Generate readmes.
- [sh-hsh]() : Generate shell script bundles and execute them remotelly.
- [sh-hclip]() : Manage clipboard and take screenshots from the terminal.
- [sh-hpkg]() : Toolchain agnostic tar.gz based package manager.
- [sh-hrun]() : Run programs in custom sysroots, execute C programs as scripts.
- [sh-hssh-pipe]() : SSH tunnels to servers.
- [sh-hsql]() : SQL client wrapper for common operations.
- [sh-hnav]() : A wrapper around web browsers to expose same flags.
- [sh-hhttpd]() : A wrapper around minimalist HTTP servers. Good for testing.
- [sh-hemacs]() : An script to configure GNU/Emacs editor.
- [sh-hprofile]() : Interactive terminal environment configurator.
- [sh-hformat]() : Pendrive formater script.
- [sh-hiso]() : Operating system ISO and IMG handler.
- [sh-hmd]() : Extract information from tables in md files.
- [sh-hcapw]() : Capture Wireshark captures in a remote server.
- [sh-hburn]() : This script extracts the image and burns it to disk.
- [sh-hcontact]() : Manage your contacts from the terminal.
- [sh-genh]() : Generate header files from C source files.
- [sh-hback]() : Backup mechanism good to backup family photos and videos.
- [sh-htrash]() : Move to trash from the terminal.
- [sh-hbackup]() : Backup mechanism.
- [sh-hbackup-ssh]() : Connect to a server using SSH and get backups.
- [sh-hbackup-hsql]() : Create backups of databases.
- [sh-hmail]() : Mail configuration utility. (mailx, mail, msmtp, mbsync, mu, mu4e)
- [sh-hdocker]() : Docker helper commands.
- [sh-rig3]() : RiG (Random Identity generator) implemented in shell language.
- [sh-hipfs]() : An easy way for scripts to download needed files from IPFS. 
- [sh-hxdg]() : Assign mimes to programs and create links to "start menu".

## Minimalist C libraries.
